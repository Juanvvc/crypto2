A project to document Marp and Reveal using examples.

Use to store themes and Makefiles

# Marp

Since this is my preferred system, themes and examples are much more developed than RevealJS

Usage:

```
make THEME=marp-incide marp-tutorial.md
```

Check the Makefile for additional examples

# RevealJS

Much less developed than Marp themes and examples, it is just a test
